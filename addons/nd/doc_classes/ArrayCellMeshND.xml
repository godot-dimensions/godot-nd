		Custom ND cell mesh class.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		ArrayCellMeshND is a class for specifying cell meshes with arrays of data, including the vertices and cells. Unlike the specialized [CellMeshND] classes such as [BoxCellMeshND], ArrayCellMeshND can store any cell mesh, allowing users to create custom meshes with arbitrary data.

		<method name="append_vertex">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="vertex" type="PackedFloat64Array" />
			<param index="1" name="deduplicate_vertices" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Append a vertex to the cell mesh. If [param deduplicate_vertices] is [code]true[/code], the method will check if the vertex already exists in the [member vertices] array and return the index of the existing vertex. If the vertex does not exist, it will be appended to the vertices array and its index will be returned. In both cases, the returned index points to a vertex identical to the input vertex.

		<method name="merge_with">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="other" type="ArrayCellMeshND" />
			<param index="1" name="transform" type="TransformND" />
			<description>
				Merges the current cell mesh with another cell mesh, copying the contents of [param other] into this cell mesh with a relative transform of [param transform]. If only one of the meshes has normals, the other normals will be initialized to zero.

		<member name="cell_face_normals" type="PackedFloat64Array[]" setter="set_cell_face_normals" getter="get_cell_face_normals" default="[]">
			The normals of the simplex cells. Face normals define which side of the cell is the front side, and therefore should be drawn. Face normals can also be used to calculate vertex normals to determine how lighting angles are calculated for the cell. Each VectorN ([PackedFloat64Array]) in this array is for one cell, and should be normalized. This array should either be one-Nth as long as the [member cell_indices] array, or empty for no normals, or else the mesh is invalid.
		</member>
		<member name="cell_indices" type="PackedInt32Array" setter="set_cell_indices" getter="get_cell_indices" default="PackedInt32Array()">
			The indices of the cell cells. Every 4 integers defines a cell cell. Each integer is an index to the [member vertices] array. Integers in this array should not exceed the length of the vertices array, or else the mesh is invalid.
		</member>
		<member name="cell_vertex_normals" type="PackedFloat64Array[]" setter="set_cell_vertex_normals" getter="get_cell_vertex_normals" default="[]">
			The normals of the vertex indices of simplex cells. Vertex normals define how lighting angles are calculated for the cell. Each VectorN ([PackedFloat64Array]) in this array is for one vertex instance in a tetrahedral cell, meaning N per cell, and each should be normalized. This array should either be the same length as the [member cell_indices] array, or empty for no normals, or else the mesh is invalid.
		</member>
		<member name="dimension" type="int" setter="set_dimension" getter="get_dimension" default="0">
			The dimension of the mesh. This is calculated as the length of the first vertex. Setting this will resize all vertices to the new dimension, either truncating them or padding them with zeros as necessary. The amount of indices making up a simplex cell is equal to the dimension.
		</member>
		<member name="vertices" type="PackedFloat64Array[]" setter="set_vertices" getter="get_vertices" default="[]">
			The vertices of the cell mesh. Each vertex is a VectorN ([PackedFloat64Array]) with a length equal to the number of dimensions. Indices of cells and edges refer to the items in this array. The vertices array must be kept consistent with the cell indices array, such that each cell index points to a valid vertex index, or else the mesh is invalid.
