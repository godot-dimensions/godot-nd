	<brief_description>
		Class for working with N-dimensional basis matrices.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		BasisND represents the basis of N-dimensional transformations with an MxN matrix for rotation/scale/skew/shear/flip. The basis matrix may be non-square, but it is often square. This class can be used for transformations in 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, and so on when square, or transformations between dimensions such as 3D to 2D or 2D to 3D when not square. Use [method set_dimension] or [method with_dimension] to force the dimension of the basis to a specific value.
		The basis matrix is stored in column-major order. It may be a jagged array, where each column has a different dimension. This allows for saving memory, only allocating the values that are needed. This means that for example if you have a 1000-dimensional game and only want to rotate between dimension indices 2 and 4, you just need to have 5 columns, where most are empty, but column indices 2 and 4 each have 5 values: column 2 would have [code][0, 0, cos, 0, -sin][/code] and column 4 would have [code][0, 0, sin, 0, cos][/code]. Use [method from_rotation] if you want to construct such a rotation matrix. The dimension of this basis would be 5, but it can be used together with other basis matrices of different dimensions.

	<methods>
		<method name="add" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="other" type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Adds this basis to another basis. This is equivalent to adding the basis matrices together. This operation is not meaningful by itself, but it may be useful as part of a larger calculation.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="compose_expand" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="child_transform" type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Composes the bases, and expands to the maximum dimension in terms of basis width and basis height. For example, if a parent basis is a 2x3 matrix and a child basis is a 3x4 matrix, the output basis would be 4x4.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="compose_shrink" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="child_transform" type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Composes the bases, allowing cross-dimension transforms to shrink the dimension of the basis. For example, if a parent basis is a 2x3 matrix and a child basis is a 3x4 matrix, the output basis would be 2x4.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="compose_square" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="child_transform" type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Composes (multiplies/combines) this basis with another basis. This transforms [param child_transform] by this basis (the parent) in the order of [code]parent * child[/code]. This uses the basis columns to determine the dimension, which works for most cases with square matrices, and is fast to calculate.
				Use [method compose_expand] if you want a more expensive calculation that ensures the dimension is always expanded, or use [method compose_shrink] if you want to allow cross-dimension transforms to shrink the dimension of the basis.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="conformalized" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the basis conformalized, meaning that the basis vectors are orthogonal and have a uniform scale. This is useful for ensuring that the basis preserves angles, shapes, and distance ratios.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="determinant" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the determinant of the basis matrix. This number represents how space is scaled by the transformation. This is non-zero for any invertible square matrix within the same dimension, and always zero for non-invertible matrices and non-square matrices, such as matrices that convert 3D to 2D (the 3D space is flattened to a plane, so it has no volume, and so it scales the space to zero) or convert 2D to 3D (the span is at most a 2D plane embedded in 3D space, which has a volume of zero).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="divide_scalar" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="scalar" type="float" />
			<description>
				Divides this basis by a scalar. This is equivalent to dividing the basis matrix by the scalar. This operation is not meaningful by itself, but it may be useful as part of a larger calculation.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="duplicate" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy or clone of the basis. The underlying data uses Godot's Vector type, which is copy-on-write, so this is a cheap operation if the basis is not modified.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="from_2d" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="transform" type="Transform2D" />
			<description>
				Creates a 2-dimensional [BasisND] from a 2D [Transform2D]. The basis matrix will be a 2x2 matrix.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="from_3d" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="basis" type="Basis" />
			<description>

			<param index="0" name="basis" type="Projection" />
			<description>

		<method name="from_rotation" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="rot_from" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="rot_to" type="int" />
			<param index="2" name="rot_angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Creates a rotation matrix that rotates in the plane specified by dimension [param rot_from] to dimension [param rot_to] by the specified [param rot_angle] in radians. The indices are zero-indexed, and the dimension of the returned basis is the maximum of [param rot_from] and [param rot_to] plus one.
				For parity with how 3D rotations work, you should swap the indices if they have an even separation. For example, use [code]from_rotation(0, 1, angle)[/code], [code]from_rotation(1, 2, angle)[/code], but use [code]from_rotation(2, 0, angle)[/code] instead of [code]from_rotation(0, 2, angle)[/code]. This function will not perform swapping for you, it will conform to the convention of the indices you provide.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="from_rotation_scale" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="rot_from" type="int" />

			<param index="2" name="rot_angle" type="float" />
			<param index="3" name="scale" type="PackedFloat64Array" />
			<description>
				Creates a basis with both a rotation and a scale. The rotation is in the plane specified by dimension [param rot_from] to dimension [param rot_to] by the specified [param rot_angle] in radians. The indices are zero-indexed, and the dimension of the basis matrix is the maximum of [param rot_from] plus one, [param rot_to] plus one, and the length of the scale vector.
			</description>

		<method name="from_scale" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="BasisND" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="PackedFloat64Array" />

			<description>
				Returns the absolute uniform scale, which the average of the absolute scale. This does not return negative values in the case of a flip/reflection.

			</description>
		</method>

				Returns the transpose of the basis. If the basis matrix is orthonormal, this is equivalent to the inverse. This is much cheaper to compute than [method inverse], but this only functions as the inverse for rotation matrices without scale.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_conformal" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the basis matrix is conformal, meaning that the basis vectors are orthogonal and have a uniform scale. This is useful for ensuring that the basis preserves angles, shapes, and distance ratios.

			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this [BasisND] and [param other] are approximately equal, by running [method @GlobalScope.is_equal_approx] on each component.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function is only concerned with mathematical equality, regardless of dimensions. For example, a 2D identity basis will be considered equal to a 3D identity basis. If you need to ensure dimensions are equal as well, check their dimensions before calling this function.
