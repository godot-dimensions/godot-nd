		Instance of a ND mesh in the scene.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		MeshInstanceND is a node that places a [MeshND] in the ND scene. Meshes are used to visibly represent objects in ND, just like how [MeshInstance3D] is used in 3D scenes.
		The geometry of the mesh is defined by the [MeshND] assigned to the [member mesh] property. This may be set to any [MeshND] derived class. [WireMeshND] allows for wireframe meshes, which draw using lines.
		Meshes may have their appearance modified by setting a [MaterialND]. The [WireMaterialND] class is meant to be used with [WireMeshND] meshes. Materials may be set on the [MeshND] itself, or overridden on a per-instance basis by setting the [member material_override] property on MeshInstanceND.

		<method name="get_active_material" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="MaterialND" />
			<description>
				Returns the currently active [MaterialND] for this mesh instance. If [member material_override] is set, this will return that material. Otherwise, if [member mesh] is set to a valid [MeshND], this will return the material set on that mesh. If neither of these are set, this will return null.

		<member name="material_override" type="MaterialND" setter="set_material_override" getter="get_material_override">
			The [MaterialND] used to render the mesh. This material defines the appearance of the mesh, including its color, texture, and lighting properties. The [WireMaterialND] type is intended for wireframe meshes. This property overrides the per-mesh material set on the [MeshND] resource in the [member MeshND.material] property.

			The [MeshND] resource that defines the geometry of the mesh. This may be set to any [MeshND] derived class. [WireMeshND] allows for wireframe meshes, which draw using lines.
