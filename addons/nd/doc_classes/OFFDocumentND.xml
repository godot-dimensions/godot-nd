		Import ND mesh data from the OFF file format.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		OFFDocumentND provides functions for working with the OFF file format, which is a simple text-based format for representing polygonal geometry in ND. There are functions for loading and saving OFF files, and for converting the OFF data to a ND [ArrayWireMeshND] resource.
		In the editor, you can import OFF files as [ArrayWireMeshND] or a scene the mesh in a [MeshInstanceND] node. To change the type, select the file in the FileSystem dock, and change the "Import As" dropdown in the Import dock.

	<methods>
		<method name="export_save_to_file">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Saves the OFF data to a file on disk in the OFF format (".off" file extension) with any dimension (4OFF, 5OFF, etc). If [member edge_count] is zero, the edge count will be calculated from the face data.

		</method>
		<method name="import_generate_array_cell_mesh_nd">
			<return type="ArrayCellMeshND" />
			<description>
				Generates an ND [ArrayCellMeshND] resource from the OFF data, for use with [MeshInstanceND]. If there are any per-cell colors in the highest dimension, they will be used as cell colors in a [CellMaterialND], and any lower dimension colors will be discarded.

		</method>
		<method name="import_generate_node">
			<return type="Node" />
			<param index="0" name="deduplicate_edges" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Generates a scene with a [MeshInstanceND] node that contains an [ArrayWireMeshND] mesh generated from the OFF data.

		</method>
		<method name="import_generate_wire_mesh_nd">
			<return type="ArrayWireMeshND" />
			<param index="0" name="deduplicate_edges" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Generates an ND [ArrayWireMeshND] resource from the OFF data, for use with [MeshInstanceND]. If there are any per-face colors, they will be used as edge colors in a [WireMaterialND], and any cell colors of higher dimension will be discarded. If [param deduplicate_edges] is [code]true[/code], the generated wire mesh will only have one edge for each unique edge in the OFF data. Note that converting to a wireframe is a one-way operation, the resulting [ArrayWireMeshND] cannot be converted back to OFF data.

		<method name="import_load_from_byte_array" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="OFFDocumentND" />
			<param index="0" name="data" type="PackedByteArray" />
			<description>
				Loads an OFF file from an in-memory byte array and returns an OFFDocumentND with the data. If there is a problem with the file, at most one warning will be printed, and the code will attempt to continue loading the file anyway.
