		A ND cell mesh representing an orthoplex.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		OrthoplexCellMeshND is a class for generating cell meshes representing orthoplexes, also known as the 16-cell, hexadecachoron, or ND cross-polytope. A 4D orthoplex is composed of 8 vertices, plus or minus on each axis (-X, +X, -Y, +Y, -Z, +Z, -W, +W), and 16 cell cells.
		The 3D version of an orthoplex is the octahedron, which has 6 vertices (-X, +X, -Y, +Y, -Z, +Z) and 8 triangular faces in each octant. The 2D version is a diamond (square rotated 45 degrees), which has 4 vertices (-X, +X, -Y, +Y) and 4 edges in each quadrant. Orthoplexes exist in all dimensions, and are the dual of boxes (square/cube/hypercube).

		<method name="from_orthoplex_wire_mesh" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="OrthoplexCellMeshND" />
			<param index="0" name="wire_mesh" type="OrthoplexWireMeshND" />
			<description>
				Creates an orthoplex cell mesh from [OrthoplexWireMeshND]. The orthoplex cell mesh will have the same size and material as the wireframe mesh.

		<method name="to_orthoplex_wire_mesh" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="OrthoplexWireMeshND" />
			<description>
				Converts this orthoplex cell mesh to a [OrthoplexWireMeshND]. The wireframe mesh will have the same size and material as the cell mesh.

	<members>
		<member name="dimension" type="int" setter="set_dimension" getter="get_dimension" default="0">
			The dimension of the orthoplex. This is calculated as the length of [member size]. Setting this will resize [member size] to the new dimension.
		</member>
		<member name="half_extents" type="PackedFloat64Array" setter="set_half_extents" getter="get_half_extents">
			The half-extents of the orthoplex in meters, also known as just "extents". This is the "radius" of the orthoplex, the distance between each vertex and the center. This is a wrapper around [member size] for situations where you want to use the extents instead of size.
		</member>
		<member name="size" type="PackedFloat64Array" setter="set_size" getter="get_size" default="PackedFloat64Array()">
			The size of the orthoplex in meters. This is the axis-aligned "diameter" size of the box in ND space, where each component is the distance between opposite vertices. This is the value that is stored internally.
